## Data

This directory holds data for your project. By default, all items in the following directories are gitignored. You should be able to re-create the data without saving it to GitHub (ahem, reproducible research).  

```bash
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
```
